Displays memory/RAM usage for each plugin as they are activated and deactivated.

== Description ==

Once the Memory Usage Monitor plugin is activated, activating or deactivating any other plugin will display the memory used by that plugin. e.g:

Memory usage for WP Memory: 0.02 MB

For accurate memory usage breakdown for each plugin, you must activate or deactivate them individually; you will not see memory usage when bulk activating plugins.
